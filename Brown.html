<p><strong>A Woman of Jocotepec</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You walk along the street &amp; there's a woman in that shop you say Buenas Dias on your way to the plaza.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When your eyes meet - you know they will, you know she is in that place, &amp; she looks up every time you go by (sometimes she is in the back with her back turned, but you almost never want to be in the frame of mind to hope for that, that she won't see you) - so you walk along the street &amp; turn your mind away from this coming meeting, because you don't want to think about it &amp; think about it, &amp; wind your mind up so tight you are screwed to the back of your head &amp; can't come out, so you tuck your mind into your shoulder, &amp; let it ride along, letting it happen - as her whole body glances at you, you catch her, like a heron, fishing, pretending even to himself to be asleep, not asleep inside his feathers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So you are there, with your heart the center of your consciousness beating, &amp; it does not skip off: these pairs of eyes meeting, this greeting spoken, these smiles pulling curious curving faces open, like fingers on bellies, - this casual greeting hits right above the breast &amp; does not skip off, but turns inward &amp; darts toward the bottom, &amp; goes right thru the pool a ring around your feet spreading out, &amp; comes right back up thru the head opening.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the soft spot on your crown, &amp; the dove flies down thru your ear.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every morning this warm light this woman makes me in the streets of this town.</p>
