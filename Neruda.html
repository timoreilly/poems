<p><em>When first I saw your naked body, I saw Neruda&rsquo;s &ldquo;moon-lines, apple pathways&rdquo; in the stretch marks on your hips. I find them extraordinarily beautiful.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Love Sonnet XXVII</strong></p>

<p>by Pablo Neruda</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Naked, you are simple as one of your hands,</p>

<p>Smooth, earthy, small, transparent, round:</p>

<p>You have moon-lines, apple-pathways:</p>

<p>Naked, you are slender as a naked grain of wheat.</p>

<p>Naked, you are blue as the night in Cuba;</p>

<p>You have vines and stars in your hair;</p>

<p>Naked, you are spacious and yellow</p>

<p>As summer in a golden church.</p>

<p>Naked, you are tiny as one of your nails,</p>

<p>Curved, subtle, rosy, till the day is born</p>

<p>And you withdraw to the underground world,</p>

<p>as if down a long tunnel of clothing and of chores:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your clear light dims, gets dressed, drops its leaves,</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">And becomes a naked hand again.</span></p>
