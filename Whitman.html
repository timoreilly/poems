<p><em>For better or worse.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>From &ldquo;Song of the Open Road&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>by Walt Whitman</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I do not offer the old smooth prizes,&nbsp;<br />
But offer rough new prizes,&nbsp;<br />
These are the days that must happen to you:&nbsp;<br />
You shall not heap up what is called riches,&nbsp;<br />
You shall scatter with lavish hand all that you earn or achieve.&nbsp;<br />
However sweet the laid-up stores,&nbsp;<br />
However convenient the dwellings,&nbsp;<br />
You shall not remain there.&nbsp;<br />
However sheltered the port,&nbsp;<br />
And however calm the waters,&nbsp;<br />
You shall not anchor there.&nbsp;<br />
However welcome the hospitality that welcomes you&nbsp;<br />
You are permitted to receive it but a little while&nbsp;<br />
Afoot and lighthearted, take to the open road,&nbsp;<br />
Healthy, free, the world before you,&nbsp;<br />
The long brown path before you,&nbsp;<br />
leading wherever you choose.&nbsp;<br />
Say only to one another:&nbsp;<br />
Camerado, I give you my hand!&nbsp;<br />
I give you my love, more precious than money,&nbsp;<br />
I give you myself before preaching or law:&nbsp;<br />
Will you give me yourself?&nbsp;<br />
Will you come travel with me?&nbsp;<br />
Shall we stick by each other as long as we live?</p>
