<p><em>We began here, with your shining eyes after I recited this poem, and your desire for me to take it further.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Man Watching&nbsp; </strong></p>

<p>By Rainer Maria Rilke</p>

<p>I can tell by the way the trees beat, after<br />
so many dull days, on my worried windowpanes<br />
that a storm is coming,<br />
and I hear the far-off fields say things<br />
I can&rsquo;t bear without a friend,<br />
I can&rsquo;t love without a sister</p>

<p>The storm, the shifter of shapes, drives on<br />
across the woods and across time,<br />
and the world looks as if it had no age:<br />
the landscape like a line in the psalm book,<br />
is seriousness and weight and eternity.<br />
<br />
What we choose to fight is so tiny!<br />
What fights us is so great!<br />
If only we would let ourselves be dominated<br />
as things do by some immense storm,<br />
we would become strong too, and not need names.</p>

<p>When we win it&rsquo;s with small things,<br />
and the triumph itself makes us small.<br />
What is extraordinary and eternal<br />
does not want to be bent by us.<br />
I mean the Angel who appeared<br />
to the wrestlers of the Old Testament:<br />
when the wrestler&rsquo;s sinews<br />
grew long like metal strings,<br />
he felt them under his fingers<br />
like chords of deep music.</p>

<p>Whoever was beaten by this Angel<br />
(who often simply declined the fight)<br />
went away proud and strengthened<br />
and great from that harsh hand,<br />
that kneaded him as if to change his shape.<br />
Winning does not tempt that man.<br />
This is how he grows: by being defeated, decisively,<br />
by constantly greater beings.</p>

<p><em>When first I saw your naked body, I saw Neruda&rsquo;s &ldquo;moon-lines, apple pathways&rdquo; in the stretch marks on your hips. I find them extraordinarily beautiful.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Love Sonnet XXVII </strong></p>

<p>by Pablo Neruda</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Naked, you are simple as one of your hands,</p>

<p>Smooth, earthy, small, transparent, round:</p>

<p>You have moon-lines, apple-pathways:</p>

<p>Naked, you are slender as a naked grain of wheat.</p>

<p>Naked, you are blue as the night in Cuba;</p>

<p>You have vines and stars in your hair;</p>

<p>Naked, you are spacious and yellow</p>

<p>As summer in a golden church.</p>

<p>Naked, you are tiny as one of your nails,</p>

<p>Curved, subtle, rosy, till the day is born</p>

<p>And you withdraw to the underground world,</p>

<p>as if down a long tunnel of clothing and of chores:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your clear light dims, gets dressed, drops its leaves,</p>

<p>And becomes a naked hand again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>The dark night of my soul as I struggled to find what I must do. This poem accompanied me on my trip to the Southwest.&nbsp; It helped me to let go.&nbsp; This is a difficult one, but has some transcendent moments.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>East Coker</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>By T.S. Eliot, from &ldquo;The Four Quartets&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my beginning is my end. In succession<br />
Houses rise and fall, crumble, are extended,<br />
Are removed, destroyed, restored, or in their place<br />
Is an open field, or a factory, or a by-pass.<br />
Old stone to new building, old timber to new fires,<br />
Old fires to ashes, and ashes to the earth<br />
Which is already flesh, fur and faeces,<br />
Bone of man and beast, cornstalk and leaf.<br />
Houses live and die: there is a time for building<br />
And a time for living and for generation<br />
And a time for the wind to break the loosened pane<br />
And to shake the wainscot where the field-mouse trots<br />
And to shake the tattered arras woven with a silent motto.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my beginning is my end. Now the light falls<br />
Across the open field,, leaving the deep lane<br />
Shuttered with branches, dark in the afternoon,<br />
Where you lean against a bank while a van passes,<br />
And the deep lane insists on the direction<br />
Into the village, in the electric heat<br />
Hypnotised. In a warm haze the sultry light<br />
Is absorbed, not refracted, by grey stone.<br />
The dahlias sleep in the empty silence.<br />
Wait for the early owl.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In that open field<br />
If you do not come too close, if you do not come too close,<br />
On a summer midnight, you can hear the music<br />
Of the weak pipe and the little drum<br />
And see them dancing around the bonfire<br />
the association of man and woman<br />
In daunsinge, signifying matrimonie&tilde;<br />
A dignified and commodious sacrament.<br />
Two and two, necessarye coniunction,<br />
Holding eche other by the hand or the arm<br />
Whiche betokeneth concorde. Round and round the fire<br />
Leaping through the flames, or joined in circles,<br />
Rustically solemn or in rustic laughter<br />
Lifting heavy feet in clumsy shoes,<br />
Earth feet, loam feet, lifted in country mirth<br />
Mirth of those long since under earth<br />
Nourishing the corn. Keeping time,<br />
Keeping the rhythm in their dancing<br />
As in their living in the living seasons<br />
The time of the seasons and the constellations<br />
The time of milking and the time of harvest<br />
The time of the coupling of man and woman<br />
And that of beasts. Feet rising and falling.<br />
Eating and drinking. Dung and death.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dawn points, and another day<br />
Prepares for heat and silence. Out at sea the dawn wind<br />
Wrinkles and slides. I am here<br />
Or there, or elsewhere. In my beginning.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>II</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>What is the late November doing<br />
With the disturbance of the spring<br />
And creatures of the summer heat,<br />
And snowdrops writhing under feet<br />
And hollyhocks that aim too high<br />
Red into grey and tumble down<br />
Late roses filled with early snow?<br />
Thunder rolled by the rolling stars<br />
Simulates triumphal cars<br />
Deployed in constellated wars<br />
Scorpion fights against the Sun<br />
Until the Sun and Moon go down<br />
Comets weep and Leonids fly<br />
Hunt the heavens and the plains<br />
Whirled in a vortex that shall bring<br />
The world to that destructive fire<br />
Which burns before the ice-cap reigns.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was a way of putting it - not very satisfactory:<br />
A periphrastic study in a worn-out poetical fashion,<br />
Leaving one still with the intolerable wrestle<br />
With words and meanings. The poetry does not matter.<br />
It was not (to start again) what one had expected.<br />
What was to be the value of the long looked forward to,<br />
Long hoped for calm, the autumnal serenity<br />
And the wisdom of age? Had they deceived us,<br />
Or deceived themselves, the quiet-voiced elders,<br />
Bequeathing us merely a receipt for deceit?<br />
The serenity only a deliberate hebetude,<br />
The wisdom only the knowledge of dead secrets<br />
Useless in the darkness into which they peered<br />
Or from which they turned their eyes. There is, it seems to us,<br />
At best, only a limited value<br />
In the knowledge derived from experience.<br />
The knowledge imposes a pattern, and falsifies,<br />
For the pattern is new in every moment<br />
And every moment is a new and shocking<br />
Valuation of all we have been. We are only undeceived<br />
Of that which, deceiving, could no longer harm.<br />
In the middle, not only in the middle of the way<br />
but all the way, in a dark wood, in a bramble,<br />
On the edge of a grimpen, where is no secure foothold,<br />
And menaced by monsters, fancy lights,<br />
Risking enchantment. Do not let me hear<br />
Of the wisdom of old men, but rather of their folly,<br />
Their fear of fear and frenzy, their fear of possession,<br />
Of belonging to another, or to others, or to God.<br />
The only wisdom we can hope to acquire<br />
Is the wisdom of humility: humility is endless.</p>

<p>The houses are all gone under the sea.</p>

<p>The dancers are all gone under the hill.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>III</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>O dark dark dark. They all go into the dark,<br />
The vacant interstellar spaces, the vacant into the vacant,<br />
The captains, merchant bankers, eminent men of letters,<br />
The generous patrons of art, the statesmen and the rulers,<br />
Distinguished civil servants, chairmen of many committees,<br />
Industrial lords and petty contractors, all go into the dark,<br />
And dark the Sun and Moon, and the Almanach de Gotha<br />
And the Stock Exchange Gazette, the Directory of Directors,<br />
And cold the sense and lost the motive of action.<br />
And we all go with them, into the silent funeral,<br />
Nobody's funeral, for there is no one to bury.<br />
I said to my soul, be still, and let the dark come upon you<br />
Which shall be the darkness of God. As, in a theatre,<br />
The lights are extinguished, for the scene to be changed<br />
With a hollow rumble of wings, with a movement of darkness on darkness,<br />
And we know that the hills and the trees, the distant panorama<br />
And the bold imposing facade are all being rolled away-<br />
Or as, when an underground train, in the tube, stops too long between stations<br />
And the conversation rises and slowly fades into silence<br />
And you see behind every face the mental emptiness deepen<br />
Leaving only the growing terror of nothing to think about;<br />
Or when, under ether, the mind is conscious but conscious of nothing-<br />
I said to my soul, be still, and wait without hope<br />
For hope would be hope for the wrong thing; wait without love,<br />
For love would be love of the wrong thing; there is yet faith<br />
But the faith and the love and the hope are all in the waiting.<br />
Wait without thought, for you are not ready for thought:<br />
So the darkness shall be the light, and the stillness the dancing.<br />
Whisper of running streams, and winter lightning.<br />
The wild thyme unseen and the wild strawberry,<br />
The laughter in the garden, echoed ecstasy<br />
Not lost, but requiring, pointing to the agony<br />
Of death and birth.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You say I am repeating<br />
Something I have said before. I shall say it again.<br />
Shall I say it again? In order to arrive there,<br />
To arrive where you are, to get from where you are not,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must go by a way wherein there is no ecstacy.<br />
In order to arrive at what you do not know<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must go by a way which is the way of ignorance.<br />
In order to possess what you do not possess<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must go by the way of dispossession.<br />
In order to arrive at what you are not<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must go through the way in which you are not.<br />
And what you do not know is the only thing you know<br />
And what you own is what you do not own<br />
And where you are is where you are not.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>IV</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The wounded surgeon plies the steel<br />
That questions the distempered part;<br />
Beneath the bleeding hands we feel<br />
The sharp compassion of the healer's art<br />
Resolving the enigma of the fever chart.</p>

<p>Our only health is the disease<br />
If we obey the dying nurse<br />
Whose constant care is not to please<br />
But to remind us of our, and Adam's curse,<br />
And that, to be restored, our sickness must grow worse.</p>

<p>The whole earth is our hospital<br />
Endowed by the ruined millionaire,<br />
Wherein, if we do well, we shall<br />
Die of the absolute paternal care<br />
That will not leave us, but prevents us everywhere.</p>

<p>The chill ascends from feet to knees,<br />
The fever sings in mental wires.<br />
If to be warmed, then I must freeze<br />
And quake in frigid purgatorial fires<br />
Of which the flame is roses, and the smoke is briars.</p>

<p>The dripping blood our only drink,<br />
The bloody flesh our only food:<br />
In spite of which we like to think<br />
That we are sound, substantial flesh and blood-<br />
Again, in spite of that, we call this Friday good.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>V</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So here I am, in the middle way, having had twenty years-<br />
Twenty years largely wasted, the years of&nbsp;l'entre deux guerres-<br />
Trying to use words, and every attempt<br />
Is a wholly new start, and a different kind of failure<br />
Because one has only learnt to get the better of words<br />
For the thing one no longer has to say, or the way in which<br />
One is no longer disposed to say it. And so each venture<br />
Is a new beginning, a raid on the inarticulate,<br />
With shabby equipment always deteriorating<br />
In the general mess of imprecision of feeling,<br />
Undisciplined squads of emotion. And what there is to conquer<br />
By strength and submission, has already been discovered<br />
Once or twice, or several times, by men whom one cannot hope<br />
To emulate - but there is no competition -<br />
There is only the fight to recover what has been lost<br />
And found and lost again and again: and now, under conditions<br />
That seem unpropitious. But perhaps neither gain nor loss.<br />
For us, there is only the trying. The rest is not our business.</p>

<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Home is where one starts from. As we grow older<br />
the world becomes stranger, the pattern more complicated<br />
Of dead and living. Not the intense moment<br />
Isolated, with no before and after,<br />
But a lifetime burning in every moment<br />
And not the lifetime of one man only<br />
But of old stones that cannot be deciphered.<br />
There is a time for the evening under starlight,<br />
A time for the evening under lamplight<br />
(The evening with the photograph album).<br />
Love is most nearly itself<br />
When here and now cease to matter.<br />
Old men ought to be explorers<br />
Here or there does not matter<br />
We must be still and still moving<br />
Into another intensity<br />
For a further union, a deeper communion<br />
Through the dark cold and the empty desolation,<br />
The wave cry, the wind cry, the vast waters<br />
Of the petrel and the porpoise. In my end is my beginning.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Acceptance!</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Wild Geese</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>By Mary Oliver</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You do not have to be good.<br />
You do not have to walk on your knees<br />
For a hundred miles through the desert, repenting.<br />
You only have to let the soft animal of your body<br />
love what it loves.<br />
Tell me about your despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.<br />
Meanwhile the world goes on.<br />
Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain<br />
are moving across the landscapes,<br />
over the prairies and the deep trees,<br />
the mountains and the rivers.<br />
Meanwhile the wild geese, high in the clean blue air,<br />
are heading home again.<br />
Whoever you are, no matter how lonely,<br />
the world offers itself to your imagination,<br />
calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting --<br />
over and over announcing your place<br />
in the family of things.</p>

<p><em>Our daily life: &ldquo;Every morning this warm light this woman makes me in the streets of this town.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>A Woman of Jocotepec </strong></p>

<p>by Geoff Brown</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You walk along the street &amp; there's a woman in that shop you say Buenas Dias on your way to the plaza.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When your eyes meet - you know they will, you know she is in that place, &amp; she looks up every time you go by (sometimes she is in the back with her back turned, but you almost never want to be in the frame of mind to hope for that, that she won't see you) - so you walk along the street &amp; turn your mind away from this coming meeting, because you don't want to think about it &amp; think about it, &amp; wind your mind up so tight you are screwed to the back of your head &amp; can't come out, so you tuck your mind into your shoulder, &amp; let it ride along, letting it happen - as her whole body glances at you, you catch her, like a heron, fishing, pretending even to himself to be asleep, not asleep inside his feathers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So you are there, with your heart the center of your consciousness beating, &amp; it does not skip off: these pairs of eyes meeting, this greeting spoken, these smiles pulling curious curving faces open, like fingers on bellies, - this casual greeting hits right above the breast &amp; does not skip off, but turns inward &amp; darts toward the bottom, &amp; goes right thru the pool a ring around your feet spreading out, &amp; comes right back up thru the head opening.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the soft spot on your crown, &amp; the dove flies down thru your ear.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every morning this warm light this woman makes me in the streets of this town.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>For better or worse.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>From &ldquo;Song of the Open Road&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>by Walt Whitman</p>

<p>I do not offer the old smooth prizes,&nbsp;<br />
But offer rough new prizes,&nbsp;<br />
These are the days that must happen to you:&nbsp;<br />
You shall not heap up what is called riches,&nbsp;<br />
You shall scatter with lavish hand all that you earn or achieve.&nbsp;<br />
However sweet the laid-up stores,&nbsp;<br />
However convenient the dwellings,&nbsp;<br />
You shall not remain there.&nbsp;<br />
However sheltered the port,&nbsp;<br />
And however calm the waters,&nbsp;<br />
You shall not anchor there.&nbsp;<br />
However welcome the hospitality that welcomes you&nbsp;<br />
You are permitted to receive it but a little while&nbsp;<br />
Afoot and lighthearted, take to the open road,&nbsp;<br />
Healthy, free, the world before you,&nbsp;<br />
The long brown path before you,&nbsp;<br />
leading wherever you choose.&nbsp;<br />
Say only to one another:&nbsp;<br />
Camerado, I give you my hand!&nbsp;<br />
I give you my love, more precious than money,&nbsp;<br />
I give you myself before preaching or law:&nbsp;<br />
Will you give me yourself?&nbsp;<br />
Will you come travel with me?&nbsp;<br />
Shall we stick by each other as long as we live?</p>
