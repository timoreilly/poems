<p><strong>The Man Watching&nbsp; </strong></p>

<p>By Rainer Maria Rilke</p>

<p>I can tell by the way the trees beat, after<br />
so many dull days, on my worried windowpanes<br />
that a storm is coming,<br />
and I hear the far-off fields say things<br />
I can&rsquo;t bear without a friend,<br />
I can&rsquo;t love without a sister</p>

<p>The storm, the shifter of shapes, drives on<br />
across the woods and across time,<br />
and the world looks as if it had no age:<br />
the landscape like a line in the psalm book,<br />
is seriousness and weight and eternity.<br />
<br />
What we choose to fight is so tiny!<br />
What fights us is so great!<br />
If only we would let ourselves be dominated<br />
as things do by some immense storm,<br />
we would become strong too, and not need names.</p>

<p>When we win it&rsquo;s with small things,<br />
and the triumph itself makes us small.<br />
What is extraordinary and eternal<br />
does not want to be bent by us.<br />
I mean the Angel who appeared<br />
to the wrestlers of the Old Testament:<br />
when the wrestler&rsquo;s sinews<br />
grew long like metal strings,<br />
he felt them under his fingers<br />
like chords of deep music.</p>

<p>Whoever was beaten by this Angel<br />
(who often simply declined the fight)<br />
went away proud and strengthened<br />
and great from that harsh hand,<br />
that kneaded him as if to change his shape.<br />
Winning does not tempt that man.<br />
This is how he grows: by being defeated, decisively,<br />
by constantly greater beings.</p>
