<p><em>I read this poem as I struggled to find what I must do. It accompanied me on my trip to the Southwest; it helped me to let go of my old life and choose you.&nbsp; This is a difficult poem, but has some transcendent moments.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>East Coker</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>By T.S. Eliot, from &ldquo;The Four Quartets&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my beginning is my end. In succession<br />
Houses rise and fall, crumble, are extended,<br />
Are removed, destroyed, restored, or in their place<br />
Is an open field, or a factory, or a by-pass.<br />
Old stone to new building, old timber to new fires,<br />
Old fires to ashes, and ashes to the earth<br />
Which is already flesh, fur and faeces,<br />
Bone of man and beast, cornstalk and leaf.<br />
Houses live and die: there is a time for building<br />
And a time for living and for generation<br />
And a time for the wind to break the loosened pane<br />
And to shake the wainscot where the field-mouse trots<br />
And to shake the tattered arras woven with a silent motto.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my beginning is my end. Now the light falls<br />
Across the open field,, leaving the deep lane<br />
Shuttered with branches, dark in the afternoon,<br />
Where you lean against a bank while a van passes,<br />
And the deep lane insists on the direction<br />
Into the village, in the electric heat<br />
Hypnotised. In a warm haze the sultry light<br />
Is absorbed, not refracted, by grey stone.<br />
The dahlias sleep in the empty silence.<br />
Wait for the early owl.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In that open field<br />
If you do not come too close, if you do not come too close,<br />
On a summer midnight, you can hear the music<br />
Of the weak pipe and the little drum<br />
And see them dancing around the bonfire<br />
the association of man and woman<br />
In daunsinge, signifying matrimonie&tilde;<br />
A dignified and commodious sacrament.<br />
Two and two, necessarye coniunction,<br />
Holding eche other by the hand or the arm<br />
Whiche betokeneth concorde. Round and round the fire<br />
Leaping through the flames, or joined in circles,<br />
Rustically solemn or in rustic laughter<br />
Lifting heavy feet in clumsy shoes,<br />
Earth feet, loam feet, lifted in country mirth<br />
Mirth of those long since under earth<br />
Nourishing the corn. Keeping time,<br />
Keeping the rhythm in their dancing<br />
As in their living in the living seasons<br />
The time of the seasons and the constellations<br />
The time of milking and the time of harvest<br />
The time of the coupling of man and woman<br />
And that of beasts. Feet rising and falling.<br />
Eating and drinking. Dung and death.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dawn points, and another day<br />
Prepares for heat and silence. Out at sea the dawn wind<br />
Wrinkles and slides. I am here<br />
Or there, or elsewhere. In my beginning.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;II</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>What is the late November doing<br />
With the disturbance of the spring<br />
And creatures of the summer heat,<br />
And snowdrops writhing under feet<br />
And hollyhocks that aim too high<br />
Red into grey and tumble down<br />
Late roses filled with early snow?<br />
Thunder rolled by the rolling stars<br />
Simulates triumphal cars<br />
Deployed in constellated wars<br />
Scorpion fights against the Sun<br />
Until the Sun and Moon go down<br />
Comets weep and Leonids fly<br />
Hunt the heavens and the plains<br />
Whirled in a vortex that shall bring<br />
The world to that destructive fire<br />
Which burns before the ice-cap reigns.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was a way of putting it - not very satisfactory:<br />
A periphrastic study in a worn-out poetical fashion,<br />
Leaving one still with the intolerable wrestle<br />
With words and meanings. The poetry does not matter.<br />
It was not (to start again) what one had expected.<br />
What was to be the value of the long looked forward to,<br />
Long hoped for calm, the autumnal serenity<br />
And the wisdom of age? Had they deceived us,<br />
Or deceived themselves, the quiet-voiced elders,<br />
Bequeathing us merely a receipt for deceit?<br />
The serenity only a deliberate hebetude,<br />
The wisdom only the knowledge of dead secrets<br />
Useless in the darkness into which they peered<br />
Or from which they turned their eyes. There is, it seems to us,<br />
At best, only a limited value<br />
In the knowledge derived from experience.<br />
The knowledge imposes a pattern, and falsifies,<br />
For the pattern is new in every moment<br />
And every moment is a new and shocking<br />
Valuation of all we have been. We are only undeceived<br />
Of that which, deceiving, could no longer harm.<br />
In the middle, not only in the middle of the way<br />
but all the way, in a dark wood, in a bramble,<br />
On the edge of a grimpen, where is no secure foothold,<br />
And menaced by monsters, fancy lights,<br />
Risking enchantment. Do not let me hear<br />
Of the wisdom of old men, but rather of their folly,<br />
Their fear of fear and frenzy, their fear of possession,<br />
Of belonging to another, or to others, or to God.<br />
The only wisdom we can hope to acquire<br />
Is the wisdom of humility: humility is endless.</p>

<p>The houses are all gone under the sea.</p>

<p>The dancers are all gone under the hill.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;III</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>O dark dark dark. They all go into the dark,<br />
The vacant interstellar spaces, the vacant into the vacant,<br />
The captains, merchant bankers, eminent men of letters,<br />
The generous patrons of art, the statesmen and the rulers,<br />
Distinguished civil servants, chairmen of many committees,<br />
Industrial lords and petty contractors, all go into the dark,<br />
And dark the Sun and Moon, and the Almanach de Gotha<br />
And the Stock Exchange Gazette, the Directory of Directors,<br />
And cold the sense and lost the motive of action.<br />
And we all go with them, into the silent funeral,<br />
Nobody's funeral, for there is no one to bury.<br />
I said to my soul, be still, and let the dark come upon you<br />
Which shall be the darkness of God. As, in a theatre,<br />
The lights are extinguished, for the scene to be changed<br />
With a hollow rumble of wings, with a movement of darkness on darkness,<br />
And we know that the hills and the trees, the distant panorama<br />
And the bold imposing facade are all being rolled away-<br />
Or as, when an underground train, in the tube, stops too long between stations<br />
And the conversation rises and slowly fades into silence<br />
And you see behind every face the mental emptiness deepen<br />
Leaving only the growing terror of nothing to think about;<br />
Or when, under ether, the mind is conscious but conscious of nothing-<br />
I said to my soul, be still, and wait without hope<br />
For hope would be hope for the wrong thing; wait without love,<br />
For love would be love of the wrong thing; there is yet faith<br />
But the faith and the love and the hope are all in the waiting.<br />
Wait without thought, for you are not ready for thought:<br />
So the darkness shall be the light, and the stillness the dancing.<br />
Whisper of running streams, and winter lightning.<br />
The wild thyme unseen and the wild strawberry,<br />
The laughter in the garden, echoed ecstasy<br />
Not lost, but requiring, pointing to the agony<br />
Of death and birth.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You say I am repeating<br />
Something I have said before. I shall say it again.<br />
Shall I say it again? In order to arrive there,<br />
To arrive where you are, to get from where you are not,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must go by a way wherein there is no ecstacy.<br />
In order to arrive at what you do not know<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must go by a way which is the way of ignorance.<br />
In order to possess what you do not possess<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must go by the way of dispossession.<br />
In order to arrive at what you are not<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must go through the way in which you are not.<br />
And what you do not know is the only thing you know<br />
And what you own is what you do not own<br />
And where you are is where you are not.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IV</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The wounded surgeon plies the steel<br />
That questions the distempered part;<br />
Beneath the bleeding hands we feel<br />
The sharp compassion of the healer's art<br />
Resolving the enigma of the fever chart.</p>

<p>Our only health is the disease<br />
If we obey the dying nurse<br />
Whose constant care is not to please<br />
But to remind us of our, and Adam's curse,<br />
And that, to be restored, our sickness must grow worse.</p>

<p>The whole earth is our hospital<br />
Endowed by the ruined millionaire,<br />
Wherein, if we do well, we shall<br />
Die of the absolute paternal care<br />
That will not leave us, but prevents us everywhere.</p>

<p>The chill ascends from feet to knees,<br />
The fever sings in mental wires.<br />
If to be warmed, then I must freeze<br />
And quake in frigid purgatorial fires<br />
Of which the flame is roses, and the smoke is briars.</p>

<p>The dripping blood our only drink,<br />
The bloody flesh our only food:<br />
In spite of which we like to think<br />
That we are sound, substantial flesh and blood-<br />
Again, in spite of that, we call this Friday good.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;V</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So here I am, in the middle way, having had twenty years-<br />
Twenty years largely wasted, the years of&nbsp;l'entre deux guerres-<br />
Trying to use words, and every attempt<br />
Is a wholly new start, and a different kind of failure<br />
Because one has only learnt to get the better of words<br />
For the thing one no longer has to say, or the way in which<br />
One is no longer disposed to say it. And so each venture<br />
Is a new beginning, a raid on the inarticulate,<br />
With shabby equipment always deteriorating<br />
In the general mess of imprecision of feeling,<br />
Undisciplined squads of emotion. And what there is to conquer<br />
By strength and submission, has already been discovered<br />
Once or twice, or several times, by men whom one cannot hope<br />
To emulate - but there is no competition -<br />
There is only the fight to recover what has been lost<br />
And found and lost again and again: and now, under conditions<br />
That seem unpropitious. But perhaps neither gain nor loss.<br />
For us, there is only the trying. The rest is not our business.</p>

<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Home is where one starts from. As we grow older<br />
the world becomes stranger, the pattern more complicated<br />
Of dead and living. Not the intense moment<br />
Isolated, with no before and after,<br />
But a lifetime burning in every moment<br />
And not the lifetime of one man only<br />
But of old stones that cannot be deciphered.<br />
There is a time for the evening under starlight,<br />
A time for the evening under lamplight<br />
(The evening with the photograph album).<br />
Love is most nearly itself<br />
When here and now cease to matter.<br />
Old men ought to be explorers<br />
Here or there does not matter<br />
We must be still and still moving<br />
Into another intensity<br />
For a further union, a deeper communion<br />
Through the dark cold and the empty desolation,<br />
The wave cry, the wind cry, the vast waters<br />
Of the petrel and the porpoise. In my end is my beginning.</p>
